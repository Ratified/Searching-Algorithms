# Search Algorithms

This repo contains two search algorithms, linear search and binary search.

## Linear Search

Linear Search Algorithm is a search algorithm that sequentially searches for an element in a list, until the match  
is found. It returns the position (index) of the element when found.

## Binary Search

 The binary search algorithm is an efficient searching algorithm that is used to find a specific target value within a sorted array or list. It follows a divide-and-conquer approach by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the target value is found or the search space is exhausted.

 **NB: The array or list should be sorted.**
